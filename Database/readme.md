Diffrence between Relational and NoSql databases:
- SQL databases are relational, NoSQL are non-relational.
- SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
- SQL databases are vertically scalable, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
- SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores.
- SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, NoSQL are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
