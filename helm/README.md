Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes applications. Helm packages all of the different Kubernetes resources 
(such as deployments, services, and ingress) into a chart, which may be hosted in a repository. 
Users can pull down charts and install them on any number of Kubernetes clusters.
Helm’s approach scales from monoliths to complex micro service applications. 
Here are some of Helm’s main features:  

    Find and use popular software packaged as Kubernetes charts
    Distribute your own applications (either private or FOSS)
    A defined structure for managing Kubernetes resource manifests
    Preconfigured installations
    Parameterized installations by overriding defaults
    Automatic revision history for all releases
    Seamless upgrades and rollbacks between chart versions
    Hooks for chart authors to manage the life cycle
    Support for running tests after installing a chart
